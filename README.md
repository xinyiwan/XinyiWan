I am doing my master study in Medical Engineering at the Royal institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm 🇸🇪. I focus on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, especially fMRI and dMRI. 

Currently, I work as an research assistant at SUBIC (🧠 Stockholm University Brain Imaging Center), and working on a model-based physiological noise correction tool of fMRI.


🔭 Projects & Interest 🌱

- A model-based physiological noise correction tool of fMRI.
- Diffusion MRI is one of my study area. ✨ New project in August: The performance analysis of filtering tools in dMRI, especially COMMIT. 
- Working slowly on my website.. 👀
- Sometimes training 🏋🏻‍♀️ and attending marathons 🏃.
